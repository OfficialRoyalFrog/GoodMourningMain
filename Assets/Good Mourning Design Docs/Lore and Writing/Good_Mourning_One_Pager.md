# Good Mourning — One-Pager

## Tagline
*A cozy management sim about keeping ghosts happy enough to leave.*

## Genre
Cult-/colony-lite with emotional simulation and a touch of dungeon-delving.

## Core Loop
1. **Care** for spirits – feed, clean, comfort.  
2. **Manage** your sanctuary – build, craft, assign tasks.  
3. **Ritual** to stabilize Harmony and heal unrest.  
4. **Release** ghosts when they’re content.

## Player Fantasy
You’re the caretaker of a haunted sanctuary—part counselor, part janitor, part reaper.  
You balance compassion and chaos as you keep the dead busy, happy, and eventually at peace.

## Tone
Cute but creepy.  
Sweet decay.  
Humor mixed with melancholy.

## Art Direction
Storybook-gothic pastel world lit by candles and fog.  
Soft outlines, paper-craft feel, matte textures, cozy lighting.  
Visual keywords: *pastel decay, candle hush, storybook haunted, tender dread.*

## Audio Direction
“A lullaby for ghosts.”  
Toy piano, bowed glass, whisper choirs, and wood percussion.  
If it sounds cute, let it rot a little.

## Platforms
- PC (Steam Early Access target)  
- Nintendo Switch (planned Year 2 port)

## Elevator Pitch
**Good Mourning** is a cozy-creepy management game about running an afterlife sanctuary.  
Keep your ghosts comfortable, clean up their ectoplasm, perform rituals, and decide who gets to move on.  
Every tantrum, puddle, and farewell is part of the story.
