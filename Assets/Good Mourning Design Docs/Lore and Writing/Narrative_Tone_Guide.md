# Narrative Tone Guide — *Good Mourning*

**Cute but creepy.** Sweet rituals in a haunted garden. Ghosts are people; grief is gentle, sometimes funny.
- **Humor:** Playful, not snarky; macabre with kindness. 'Squeaks on applause.'
- **Darkness:** Manifest leaks, Rot, and banishment have weight — never trivialize.
- **Hope:** Release is bittersweet; Grace is permission to rest.

**Voice Examples**
- *Bright:* “Everything’s fine! Probably!”
- *Mournful:* “If you plant me flowers, maybe I’ll stop crying.”
- *Spiteful:* “I fixed the fence. Then I broke it again.”
