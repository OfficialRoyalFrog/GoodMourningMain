# Marketing Outline v0.1 — *Good Mourning*

## Overview
A cozy-cult management game where you care for ghosts until they’re ready to move on.  
Cute, creepy, heartfelt, and a little unhinged — Cult of the Lamb meets Graveyard Keeper with pastel horror vibes.

## Tagline
**“Keep them happy enough to leave.”**

## Tone
Sweet decay. Tender dread. Macabre but kind.  
Funny, haunted, and unexpectedly warm.

## Core Hook
Build and run an afterlife sanctuary where every tantrum, puddle, and farewell becomes part of the story.  
Your compassion is the currency — and sometimes the chaos.

## Keywords
Cozy · Creepy · Heartfelt · Rituals · Ghosts · Gardening · Management · Humor · Grief  

## Elevator Pitch
**Good Mourning** is a cozy management sim about running a haunted sanctuary.  
Feed, comfort, and clean up after restless spirits, perform rituals, and decide who gets to pass on.  
Every day is a balance between compassion and catastrophe.

## Visual Identity
- Pastel-gothic palette: candlelight gold, fog violet, moss green, bone white.  
- 2.5D stylized world with paper-craft charm.  
- “Storybook haunted” art direction — soft bloom, gentle fog, and warm light over cool shadow.  
- Simple logo: serif + lantern icon, soft off-white on charcoal background.

## Brand Voice
Playful, empathetic, darkly funny.  
- “If it’s cute, let it rot a little.”  
- “Every ghost deserves a good afterlife.”  
- “The messier the haunting, the better the story.”
