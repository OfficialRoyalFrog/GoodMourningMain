# Audio Direction – *Good Mourning*

**Core Tone:** "A lullaby for ghosts."  
Instruments: toy piano, bowed glass, wet wood percussion, whisper choir.

## Mood Bands
| Situation | Palette | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Daytime Hub | detuned bells + soft hum | Comfort with melancholy. |
| Ritual | low choir + reverb bloom | Sacred but funny if interrupted. |
| Manifest Event | heartbeat thump + inverted hum | Feels like guilt breathing. |
| Garden of Rest | plucked strings + wind chime delay | Care loop comfort. |
| Dungeon Crawl | muted drums + watery echoes | Pressure, not horror. |

## SFX Motifs
- **Ectoplasm hit:** wet pop + sigh  
- **Cleanup complete:** broom sweep + small cheer  
- **Grace earned:** faint bell harmonizing with prior tones  
- **Unrest spike:** muffled laugh reversed  

## Mix Notes
- Duck music under dialogue and Manifest.  
- Silence = tension; fade back only on relief.  
- Reverb tails act as emotional punctuation.
